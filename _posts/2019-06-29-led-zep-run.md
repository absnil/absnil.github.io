Listening to music whle running is fun and when used properly it can actually be used to boost your run. Running is all about finding the equilibrium while you are at it. The more you can maintain your breathing pattern and the calmer your mind is, the more prolonged your run can be. If you keep changing pace, the breathing pattern changes, the equilibrium shifts and its easier to be tired or run out of breath and stop. So assuming you are on a treadmill and you need a time keeper to help you keep pace and motivate you to keep going, these songs might come in handy. As far as time keepers go, they don't get better than John Bonham. The order of this list is important as each song has its purpose in its place.

# 1.When the Levee Breaks
This song is the best to get started with. It has a persistent beat and the rhythm is steady enough to make you work hard to stay in beat and also stop you from overdoing it in the first quarter.

# 2.Achilles Last Stand
Now that you are all warmed up and in rhythm, it's time to fasten things up a bit. This song as all you need to keep going at the pace you are or even quicken things up a bit if you feel like.It takes off right from the onset and is an onslaught of a monstrous tempo. The solo in the middle is the icing on the cake

# 3.Kashmir
Half done now. This is the most difficult part of the run. You'll start to get tired and need more motivation to keep going at the pace you are. This is where Kashmir fits in. Again a track on slower rhythm but as persistent as When the Levee Breaks.

# 4. Since I've Been Loving You
Now its time to bring it home in style. Since I've been loving you has a lazy laidback feel to it that'll help you slow down and cool down. This has an amazing solo within it too. And ending the run with the crescendo in the coda is perfect.

# Note
 Like all forms of exercise, its most important to listen to your body. Remember to not push yourself beyond a limit and differentiate between good and bad pain. No harm in stopping the run if you feel like and listening to these songs just so because as it is they are so damn good.
