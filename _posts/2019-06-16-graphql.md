title: "A Very Basic Idea of GraphQL with resources and an API example"

Graphql is a query language for APIs, which has a few smart tricks to make good queries up its sleeve. This is meant as a basic introduction to graphql. A good and proper tuturial on how to run a apollo server with graphql can be found at [This tutorial][this-tutorial] by Jonas Helfer on Medium. It does the whole nine yards and also has all the code for reference in a github repository. A few terms are better known starting off with graphql. The list goes as follows:
1. Schema
2. Conectors
3. Resolvers

The schema contains information about data you get through the API. Most important are the `types`. `types` can be objects, scalars and a `Query`. Good documentation and [Resource][resource] can be found here.

Connectors are a level of abstraction between the back-end and graphql. Used to smoothly pass data across different entities like a MySql database and GraphQL. [More-info][more-info]

Resolvers are functions that take care of the types defined in schema. A [Good post][good-post] on resolvers can be found here.

The tutorial listed above works with the fortune cookie API examples. Other free APIs can be obtained from [Here][here]

An example of the [Jokes API][jokes-api] is as follows:

The following code is added to the `Connectos.js`
```javascript
const Joke= {
    getJoke() {
    return fetch('https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(res => {
        return res.setup +"          "+ res.punchline;
      });
  },
};


```

Code for the `Schema.js`
```javascript
 getJoke:String
```
Code for the `Resolvers.js` is an addition to the Query object
```javascript
	Query: {
    getJoke(_,args) {
      //console.log(type)
      return Joke.getJoke();
    },

  }
```

The query to then run on GraphQL is 
```
{
	getJoke
}

```

Most other String returning APIs can be executed in a similar fashion.The rest of GraphQL is open to exploration. This was just to wet your feet anyway!
