So I happened to visit an Iron Maiden concert recently and it was one of the best experiences of my life. Iron Maiden is one of my favoruite bands and I latched onto the opportunity to watch them live. And boy! was it worth it. The showmanship of all members in the band is of the highest quality and their energy levels would put teenagers to shame. Every song has a different setting,vibe, props and costumes.

And in here, Maiden just didn't hold back. Right from the onset, where they begin with "Aces High" there is a huge plane that glides on top of the stage. There is a sword fight in the middle, there are flame throwers, fire works and even a TNT explosion. The numebr of costume changes Bruce goes through is uncountable. Add to it the setting and the backdrop that changes drastically with each song. Here is a band that cares about going all out for its fans and giving them much more than they can even dream of. 
I have always read and heard about Iron Maiden concerts being amazing.

It is True and you have to see it to believe it. I was far up in the nosebleed section but I felt as involved as the people on the floor. And I still have not spoken about the music have I. Iron Maiden has aged like fine wine in that terms. All the songs are total fan service and the most recent song they play is from 2006. The only song I missed on the setlist is Dance of Death as I personally love that song. Everything else is very much there for Bruce and the crowd to sign together. The sound is absolutely breathtaking as are Janick Gers antics.

Iron Maiden is currently touring the US and I would totally suggest you don't miss a chance to see them live. I must also warn you that your expectations for concerts will be sky high after this one. Its very hard for any artist to be able to match this. On music it may even be possible but on the entire experience and showmanship, slim chance. The pictures I put up from the nosebleed section but it'll give you an idea of how epic things were.
