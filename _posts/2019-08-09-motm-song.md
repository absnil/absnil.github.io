[Banana leaf][banana-leaf] and I teamed up to create this song called 
# Maid of the Mist
 Its a song about a guy trying to get a girl out of his head albeit unsuccessfully.
 The lyrics for the song are as follows:


Spreading sunshine, with her wings, 
Shining glory,  the lady sings, 

Far away,  in the mountains she Roams, 
She gently moves around, each halt her home... 

A hundred tried for her attention, a million failed, 
She has eyes just for me,  her thoughts ain't veiled, 

I wish she goes away from my mind, 
I clinch my fist, in anger yes,

But she entices me,  with each turn and twist,
the maid of the mist... 

Give her a flying kiss,
The maid of the mist... 

She's all I wished for
In her eyes shiny tears,

Her heart now holds a couple fears, 
And I try and forget but here she is,

Playfully dancing,  you just can't miss, 
And I close my eyes so I can't see, 

But you just can't stop what is to be, 
I let go,  she's all I wish, 

All I can think about is her, 
The maid of the mist, 

Give her cheeks a twist... 

Flying into the land of dreams,
And little bit of dreaming,
sweet inside the seam, 

She opens her arms wide,  and I give in, 
I lose at this all the time but seems like a win,

I grab her close and hold her close,
Look into her eyes, as lovely as a blooming rose,

In her hand my hand we take on a world, 
It ain't not joke but you get the gist, 

The maid of the mist...

On the guitar its a simple - Am,C, Em, F chord progression with Capo on 5

Listen to the song on [Soundcloud][soundcloud].
A youtube video is in the making too.
