Playing chords is fun. Here's a list of 5 fairly easy. common but intersting chords progressions. A lot of songs are based of these progressions. Or not. Either way, these are super fun to play and practise. Don't just try these in the first position. Some of these are easier to play from other positions or sound better there. Experiment with the capo too. So here we go:


##  1) Am-C-F-G
A lot of songs are based off of this progression in different order. This is a good progression to start off as it has the 'complex' F chord so to speak.
It plays in a mostly positiv vibe with the C and G lending it a postive vibe.

##  2)B-A-G
This progression is good to get the fingers working. It has a nice ring to it too. Helps to play it from second or third postions of these chords. Much easier to shift chords if you are comfortable with bar chords.

##  3)A-Bm-C#m-D
This progression is kinda like a dark horse. Its capable of invoking the saddest and happiest feels depending on the rhythm its played at. Works well when played at 120bpm

##  4)F#m-A-B
This progression is on the sadder side in terms of feel. Its not common to come across. One can experiment by playing each chord for different bars to see what fits best.

##  5)C-Dm-Am-Fmaj7
This progression is best played by finger picking. The Dm adds a different vibe to the otherwise happy chords progression. 

So try these out. They are easy enough to be played by a beginner after a given time and interesting enough to keep good players interested. Happy playing
